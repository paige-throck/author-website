        <p>Will a 1000-year old Mayan legend, discovered by Himmler's SS in the 1930s in the Yucatán, Mexico save the world from destruction when the Mayan calendar ends on December 21, 2012? The Mayan Manifesto, a fast-paced suspense novel set in
          San
          Francisco and Chichén Itzá, Mexico in the fall of 2012, follows the quest of Alexandra King and her fellow college students who seek to answer the question raised by conspiracy theorists and Mayan scholars alike: does the end of the Mayan
          calendar portend the end of the world and is there anything to be done to save it?</p>

        <p>Perhaps historians have had it wrong all along. Did the Knights Templar find something more precious than gold or silver in Jerusalem during the Crusades?

          The Accord, an intriguing and suspenseful sequel to the author's first novel, follows Simone Bertrand, her graduate assistant, Jeff Stahl, and twin sisters Alex and Liz King, as they travel across France and Belgium in search of the true
          Templar treasure. Once possessed by the monarchs of France, The Accord, if found, could change the course of history and bring peace to the Middle East.</p>
